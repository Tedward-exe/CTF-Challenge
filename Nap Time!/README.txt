Challenge Description: I've intercepted this file and I think theres a message inside. Unfortunately, it's time for my daily nap and warm glass of milk! Can you get the encrypted message?

Explanation: Each pixel's RGB values are randomly selected and add up to a value that can be converted to ASCII. Using a program, decrypting all 256x256 pixels gets you something like, "flagflagflag...lbctf{answer}...flagflagflag"

Answer: lbctf{i_luv_fluFfi_p1ll0w$!}
